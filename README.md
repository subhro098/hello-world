Intro to GitHub
  
  There was once this badass coder, who got bored with the trivialities of life...
  He dreamed of something bigger, something more enjoyable, something infinitely more interesting...
  And so he came to learn of open source development...
  Here I am, ready for a new challenge, and boy, am I excited!!
  
  All pompousness aside, this is my first project on GitHub, and it's really fun doing this stuff...I just hope this stays with me for a     long time...
  
  P.S: In no universe am I a badass, let alone a badass coder.
